2) Auto-QA and Coaching Insights from 100% of Calls
Objective
Design an Auto-QA system that evaluates 100% of customer support calls, scores them
across quality dimensions, and generates agent-level + city-level coaching insights, with
supervisor flagging for high-risk calls.
What the System Must Evaluate
1. Script adherence + key step completion
2. Sentiment trajectory + escalation risk
3. Resolution correctness vs Battery Smart SOPs
4. Coaching insights (agent + city patterns)
5. Supervisor flags for urgent review
Candidate Deliverables
1. Scoring framework (rubric + weights)
2. What “good call” looks like (definition + examples)
3. How sentiment trajectory is measured
4. Correctness evaluation logic (SOP alignment approach)
5. Coaching insights format
○ per agent (themes + examples)
○ per city (root causes + patterns)
6. Supervisor alert policy (what gets flagged and why)
7. Dashboards mock (QA scorecards, trends, leaderboards)
8. Implementation approach (speech-to-text → QA model → insights → reporting)
Evaluation Focus
● Practical scoring design (not overly theoretical)
● Explainability of QA outputs (agents trust it)
● Actionable coaching insights (not generic)
● Risk prioritization quality
