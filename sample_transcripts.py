Agent: Thank you for calling Battery Smart customer support! My name is Priya. How may I help you today?

Customer: Hi, my battery is showing locked and I can't swap it at the station.

Agent: I apologize for the inconvenience. I can definitely help you with that. 
May I have your registered phone number to pull up your account?

Customer: Yes, it's 9876543210.

Agent: Thank you. And can you provide the battery ID? It should be on a sticker on the battery.

Customer: It says BS-2024-78456.

Agent: Perfect, I've found your account. Let me check the system status for your battery.
I can see the battery got locked due to a sync issue at the station. 
I'm sending you an unlock code right now. You should receive an SMS with an OTP within 30 seconds.

Customer: Okay, got it. Thanks!

Agent: Great! Please try the swap again with this code. The nearest station to you 
is at MG Road, about 500 meters from your last swap location. It has 5 charged batteries available.

Customer: That worked! The battery is swapped now. Thank you so much.

Agent: I'm happy to help! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for the quick help.

Agent: Hello?

Customer: Hi, I've been waiting for 20 minutes! This is ridiculous.

Agent: Yeah, we're busy. What's the problem?

Customer: My battery is locked and I'm stuck at the station! This is the third time this month!

Agent: Did you try restarting it?

Customer: That's not possible, it's locked! I need help NOW. I'm going to be late for work.

Agent: I don't know what's wrong. Maybe there's a system error code or something.
You should have checked before coming to the station.

Customer: This is unacceptable! I've been a customer for 2 years and this is how you treat me?

Agent: Look, I already told you I can't help if the system is down. 
As I said before, just wait and try again later.

Customer: I want to speak to your manager right now! I'm going to file a complaint against you.
I'll sue Battery Smart for this waste of my time. I'll post this on Twitter!

Agent: Fine, I'll transfer you. But the manager will tell you the same thing.

Customer: This is the worst service ever. I'm switching to Ather. They actually care about customers.

Customer: It's 8765432109.

Agent: Thank you. I can see the duplicate charge of Rs. 149 from yesterday at 3:45 PM.
This appears to be a technical glitch during the transaction.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration. According to our refund policy, 
duplicate charges are fully refundable. I'm initiating the refund right now.

Customer: How long will that take? I need that money back.

Agent: The refund will be processed within 3-5 business days and will be credited 
to your original payment method. You'll receive a confirmation SMS once it's processed.

Customer: That's too long. Can't you do it faster?

Agent: I wish I could expedite it, but that's the standard processing time from the bank's side.
However, as a goodwill gesture, I'm adding Rs. 50 credit to your Battery Smart wallet

the Shell petrol pump, on your left. You can also see it on your Battery Smart app.

Customer: How long does a battery last per charge?
